# KopaSmart: Smart Borrowing for Microfinance

KopaSmart is a web-based loan scoring platform designed to assist microfinance institutions (MFIs) in evaluating borrower eligibility using alternative data sources. In many developing regions, traditional credit assessment methods exclude a large portion of the population due to a lack of formal financial history. KopaSmart addresses this gap by leveraging behavioral and transactional indicators such as mobile money usage, utility payments, and repayment habits to assess creditworthiness.

The system integrates a simple, interpretable machine learning model into a user-friendly admin dashboard for loan officers. This allows MFIs to make data-driven lending decisions while promoting financial inclusion for underserved individuals. The solution is built using Django for the backend, React for the frontend, and trained on realistic synthetic data to simulate practical use cases without privacy concerns.

KopaSmart provides a scalable and accessible tool to empower ethical lending in low-resource environments.
